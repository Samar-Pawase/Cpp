/*

Arithmetic Operators are of two types:


i) Binary operators
ii) Unary operators


i) Binary operator-

    + adds the numbers
    - subracts numbers
    / divides numbers
    * multiplies numbers
    % gives reminder for division of two numbers

ii) Unary operator-

    ++ increamenter
    -- decrementer

Note -

If the unary operator is used before the number then, the operation is carried out first and then the number is displayed.
If the unary operator is placed after the number then, the number is displayed first and then the operation is carried out.


Left shift operator - a<<n  a*(2^n)
Right shift operator - a>>n a/(2^n)
